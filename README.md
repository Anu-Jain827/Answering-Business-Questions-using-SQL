# Answering-Business-Questions-using-SQL

In the project, SQL skills are used to answer business questions and working with Chinook database-information about a fictional digital music shop.


# About Chinook database -

The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. A schema diagram will help us understand the available columns and the structure of the data. A schema diagram is also uploaded here for the Chinook database.

# Aim -
In this project, we're going to practice using SQL skills to answer business questions like selecting albums to purchase, analyzing employee sales performance, and comparing album vs individual tracks.
